# AR Drum Kit App
## EC 500 Final Project
###### Jessica Barry and Gennifer Norman

## Summary

Our project is developed in React Native using Expo framework as well as using the Expo Three and AR libraries. These libraries interact with a native version of the iOS ARKit. Expo-three is used to render the scene with the instrument model and the AR library is used to show render this scene over a live camera feed. We set our camera to detect horizontal planes to more accurately replicate the experience of playing a drum kit, however it is miniaturized so that the user can easily play the entire instrument.
